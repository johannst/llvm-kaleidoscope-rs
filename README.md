# llvm-kaleidoscope-rs

Follow the official llvm tutorial [`Kaleidoscope: Implementing a Language with
LLVM`][llvm-tutorial] to learn about `llvm` and practice some `rust`.

Names of variables and functions as well as file structure are mainly kept as
in the tutorial. This makes it easy to map the `rust` implementation onto the
`C++` implementation when following the tutorial.
